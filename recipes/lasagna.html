                    Lasagna is a beloved dish with a rich history. Originating
                    from ancient Greece as “laganon,” it evolved in Italy into
                    the classic we adore today. Picture layers of perfectly
                    cooked pasta, rich meat sauce, creamy béchamel, and melted
                    cheese. Each bite is a delightful blend of flavors and
                    textures, reminiscent of an Italian trattoria. Versatile and
                    crowd-pleasing, lasagna is perfect for family dinners or
                    special occasions. Dive into this historical and delicious
                    dish and impress your loved ones!

                    <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
                    <li>
                        Heat olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add
                        onion, carrot, and garlic, and cook until softened.

                    <li>Add ground beef and pork, cooking until browned.</li>
                    <li>
                        Stir in passata, crushed tomatoes, tomato paste,
                        bouillon cubes, oregano, basil, sugar, salt, and pepper.
                        Simmer for 30 minutes.

                    <li>
                        In a separate saucepan, melt butter over medium heat.
                        Stir in flour and cook for 1 minute. Gradually whisk in

                    <li>
                        In a baking dish, spread a layer of meat sauce, followed
                        by lasagna sheets, white sauce, and mozzarella cheese.
                        Repeat layers, finishing with mozzarella on top.
